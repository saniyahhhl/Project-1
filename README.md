Kinder Morgan Network Topology 

This project shows the design of Kinder Morgan network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates my ability to create and configure a secure network topology with multiple routers, switches, and end devices.

You should be able to see The .pkt file of the network topology LIVE 

Download the file 
Make sure you have Cisco Pakcet Tracer installed
If you wish to just view an image instead of live view, I've uploaded a screenshot of how it looks. 

This project highlights my skills in networking fundamentals, configuration, and troubleshooting.
