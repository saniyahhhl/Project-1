Kinder Morgan Network Topology 

This project shows the design of Kinder Morgan network using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates my ability to create and configure a secure network topology with multiple routers, switches, and end devices.

- You should be able to see The .pkt file of the network topology LIVE 
- All you need to do is go to the first file then click raw, download the file make sure you have Cisco Pakcet Tracer installed

- If you wish to just view an image instead of live view, I've uploaded a screenshot of how it looks, which is the third file, "Top ss" 

This project highlights my skills in networking fundamentals, configuration, and troubleshooting.
